## Introduction

Easily convert numbers to words in Laravel using this library, which leverages the native `PHP INTL` extension to perform conversion effortlessly. With this library, you can convert numbers to words in various languages and also obtain the value in currency format according to the selected language. Supported languages include English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, Hindi, Polish, Vietnamese and Persian (Farsi).

**This library is compatible with PHP +8.0 and Laravel versions 8.0 and higher**

## Requirements

For this solution to work properly you must have at least a version of PHP 8.0 since the package in its CORE has typed data.

You must have Laravel Framework version 8 or higher.

Finally, our package relies on the native PHP `INTL` extension, check in your `php.ini` that you have it.

## Install

### Composer

To install the dependency via Composer, execute the following command:

``` bash
composer require rmunate/spell-number
```

The package will automatically register itself.

**That's all!**
